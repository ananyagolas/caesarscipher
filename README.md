# Programming Caesar's Cipher 

This project is named Programming Caesar's Cipher ! It encrypts and decrypts messages based off of Caesars cipher, which shifts capital letters based on a numeric key value. I created this project to continue exploring cybersecurity through the girls who code pathways program. I worked off of starter code and alongside videos to create my project. I struggled with indentation syntax with python but I learned how to format and make my code more efficient.
